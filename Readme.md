# My QMK variations and resources.

As I go on my journey on keyboard mapping and modding with QMK. I've created this repository.


For now I only have a splitkb/kyria/kolkman keyboard. [This readme documents it](https://github.com/Kolkman/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/splitkb/kyria/keymaps/kolkman/readme.md).

I used this repository earlier for the development, but moved all development under a fork of the [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/Kolkman/qmk_firmware)

 ### Some useful resources.
 
 - [keymapdb](https.keymapdb.com), in particular the [kyria keymap](https://keymapdb.com/keymaps/default-kyria/).
 - https://precondition.github.io/
 - https://github.com/andrewjrae/kyria-keymap contains a few fetures that I am considdering
 - https://github.com/getreuer/qmk-keymap
